### The mean,median and mode

The mean, median, and mode are all measures of central tendency in statistics, but they represent slightly different concepts:

1. **Mean:** The mean is also known as the average. It's calculated by adding up all the numbers in a dataset and then dividing by the total number of numbers. The mean is sensitive to extreme values, meaning if there are outliers (extreme values), they can greatly affect the mean. For example, in the dataset [1, 2, 3, 4, 100], the mean is significantly influenced by the outlier 100.

2. **Median:** The median is the middle value of a dataset when it's arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an odd number of values, the median is the middle one. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. Unlike the mean, the median is not affected by extreme values or outliers. In the dataset [1, 2, 3, 4, 100], the median is unaffected by the outlier and is 3.

3. **Mode:** The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode, more than one mode (multimodal), or no mode if all values occur with the same frequency. Unlike the mean and median, the mode is not a measure of central tendency in the sense of locating a central value; rather, it identifies the most common value or values. In the dataset [1, 2, 2, 3, 4], the mode is 2 because it appears more frequently than any other number.

So, while these concepts all relate to the center of a dataset, they each provide different insights into the data, and they may vary depending on the characteristics of the dataset, such as the presence of outliers or the distribution of values.
