### Standard deviation

The standard deviation is a measure of how spread out numbers are in a dataset. Imagine you have a bunch of numbers representing something, like test scores of students in a class. The standard deviation tells you how much those scores differ from the average (or mean) score.

Here's a simpler way to think about it: 

1. **Find the average:** First, you find the average score of all the students.
   
2. **Measure the distance:** Then, for each student's score, you measure how far it is from the average. If a student scored a lot higher or lower than the average, that distance is bigger.

3. **Square and average the distances:** You square each of these distances (to get rid of negative numbers) and find the average of these squared distances.

4. **Square root:** Finally, you take the square root of that average. This gives you the standard deviation. 

So, if the standard deviation is small, it means most scores are close to the average. If it's big, it means the scores are more spread out from the average. Think of it like this: if the average score is 70, and the standard deviation is 5, most scores are probably around 70, with only a few higher or lower. But if the standard deviation is 15, then there's more variationâ€”some scores might be much higher or lower than 70.
