### Population and population estimates

In statistics, the term "population" refers to the entire group of individuals, items, or observations about which you want to draw conclusions. It's the complete set of all possible elements that you're interested in studying.

For example:
- If you're interested in studying the average height of all adult women in a country, the population would be all adult women in that country.
- If you're interested in studying the defect rate of a specific type of product produced by a company, the population would be all units of that product produced by that company.

However, it's not always practical or feasible to collect data from every single element in the population due to reasons like time, cost, or logistics. In such cases, statisticians often use a sample—a smaller subset of the population—to make inferences about the population as a whole. This process is known as statistical sampling.

"Population estimates" refer to estimates or predictions made about characteristics or parameters of the entire population based on data collected from a sample. These estimates are calculated using statistical methods and are used to draw conclusions about the population without having to study every single individual or item within it.

For example:
- If you survey a random sample of 500 adult women in a country and calculate the average height from that sample, you can use that average as an estimate of the average height of all adult women in that country.
- If you inspect a random sample of 1000 units of a product and find that 20 of them are defective, you can use that information to estimate the defect rate for the entire population of that product.

Population estimates play a crucial role in various fields, including market research, public opinion polling, quality control in manufacturing, and many others.
