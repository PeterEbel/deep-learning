### Population parameters
In statistics, population parameters are numerical values that describe characteristics of an entire population. These parameters provide summary measures about the population as a whole and are typically unknown because it's usually impractical or impossible to measure every individual in a population. Instead, statisticians often use sample data to estimate these parameters.

Common population parameters include:

1. **Mean (μ)**: The average value of all observations in the population.

2. **Variance (σ²)**: A measure of how much the values in the population vary from the population mean. It's calculated as the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean.

3. **Standard Deviation (σ)**: The square root of the variance, which measures the spread of values around the mean.

4. **Median**: The middle value of the population data when arranged in ascending order.

5. **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value(s) in the population.

6. **Population Proportion (π)**: The proportion of individuals in the population that possess a certain characteristic or meet a specific criterion.

7. **Population Correlation Coefficient (ρ)**: A measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables in the population.

These parameters provide insights into the central tendency, variability, and other characteristics of the population. In practice, statisticians often use sample statistics, such as sample mean (x̄), sample variance (s²), sample standard deviation (s), and others, to estimate these population parameters.
