### Normal distribution

Normal distribution, also known as the bell curve, is a way to describe how numbers are spread out in a dataset. It's called "normal" because it's a very common pattern that shows up in many natural phenomena. Imagine plotting all the numbers from your dataset on a graph. The normal distribution looks like a symmetrical bell shape, with the peak at the average (or mean) value.

Here's how it works:

1. **Peak at the average:** Most of the numbers are clustered around the average value. That's why the peak of the bell curve is right at the average.

2. **Spread out symmetrically:** As you move away from the average in either direction, the numbers become less common, but they're spread out symmetrically. This means that as you go farther away from the average, the number of occurrences decreases, but in a predictable way.

3. **Standard deviation controls spread:** The spread, or width, of the bell curve is determined by the standard deviation. A small standard deviation means the numbers are tightly clustered around the average, while a large standard deviation means they're more spread out.

Normal distribution is really handy because it shows up in many real-life situations. Things like people's heights, exam scores, and even errors in measurements often follow this pattern. That's why it's used a lot in statistics and scienceâ€”it helps us understand and predict how data behaves in the real world.
