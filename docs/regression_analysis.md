### Regression Analysis

Regression analysis is a statistical method used to understand and quantify the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In simpler terms, it's like trying to find out how changes in one thing (independent variable) are associated with changes in another thing (dependent variable). Imagine you want to know how the price of a house (dependent variable) changes based on factors like the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, and the location (independent variables). Regression analysis helps you figure out how much each of these factors influences the house price.

It works by fitting a mathematical model to the data you have. This model estimates the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. For example, in linear regression, the model assumes a straight-line relationship between the variables. Once the model is fitted, you can use it to make predictions about the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables. For instance, you could predict the price of a house with certain characteristics based on the model you've developed.

Overall, regression analysis helps us understand the relationships between variables and make predictions based on those relationships.
