### Population variance

The population variance (σ²) is calculated using the following formula:

$
\begin{aligned}
\Large\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2
\end{aligned}
$

Where:
- $N$ is the size of the population (the total number of observations).
- $x_i$ represents each individual value in the population.
- $\mu$ is the population mean (average).

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the formula:

1. **Find the mean:** Calculate the mean (average) of all values in the population. This is represented by $\mu$.

2. **Calculate the squared differences:** For each individual value in the population, subtract the mean $\mu$ from the value, and square the result. This gives you the squared differences between each value and the mean.

3. **Sum the squared differences:** Add up all the squared differences calculated in step 2.

4. **Divide by population size:** Divide the sum of squared differences by the total number of observations in the population $N$. This gives you the population variance $\sigma^2$.

The population variance measures how much the values in the population deviate from the population mean on average. It's a measure of the spread or dispersion of the data points around the mean.

The population standard deviation (σ) is simply the square root of the population variance (σ²). 

Mathematically, it's represented as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Large\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

So, if you already have the population variance (\( \sigma^2 \)), you can find the population standard deviation $\sigma$ by taking the square root of the variance. The population standard deviation measures the dispersion or spread of values in the population, just like the variance, but it's expressed in the same units as the original data, rather than squared units.
