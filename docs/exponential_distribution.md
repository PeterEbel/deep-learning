### Exponential distribution:

[Back to Statistic Fundamentals](statistic_fundamentals.md)

Imagine you're waiting for something to happenâ€”maybe you're waiting for a bus to arrive, or for a lightbulb to burn out. The exponential distribution helps us understand how long we might have to wait for that event to occur.

Here's how it works:

1. **Constant rate of change:** The key idea behind the exponential distribution is that the time it takes for the event to occur has a constant rate of change. In other words, the probability of the event happening in the next minute is the same no matter how long you've already been waiting.

2. **Memoryless property:** One interesting property of the exponential distribution is that it's memoryless. This means that knowing how long you've already been waiting doesn't affect the probability of the event happening in the next moment. For example, if you've already waited 10 minutes for the bus, the probability of it arriving in the next minute is the same as if you just started waiting.

3. **Decay over time:** As time goes on, the probability of the event happening increases, but it does so in a decaying manner. This means that the longer you wait, the less likely it is that you'll have to wait much longer.

In simple terms, the exponential distribution helps us understand how likely it is for an event to occur within a certain amount of time, assuming the event happens at a constant rate and has no memory of how long you've already been waiting.

This distribution is often used in fields like queuing theory, reliability engineering, and telecommunications to model the time between events such as arrivals, failures, or transmissions.
